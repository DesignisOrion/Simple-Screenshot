# Simple Screenshot

### About 
This program allows you to take a screenshot of your computer screen. 

### Technologies Used:
- Python 3
- Pyautogui
- Tkinter

### What I learned:

In this project I was able to find more about the module Pyautogui within Tkinter. PyAutoGUI lets your Python scripts control the mouse and keyboard to automate interactions with other applications. The documentation is incredible so please try when you get a chance.
